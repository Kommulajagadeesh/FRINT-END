    <h1>HOW TO MONEY WORKS</h1>

    <p>Money is a liquid asset used to facilitate transactions of value. It is used as a medium of exchange between
        individuals and entities. It's also a store of value and a unit of account that can measure the value of other
        goods.

        Prior to the invention of money, most economies relied on bartering, where individuals would trade the goods
        they had directly for those that they needed. This raised the problem of the double coincidence of wants: a
        transaction could only take place if both participants had something that the other needed. Money eliminates
        this problem by acting as an intermediary good.

        The first known forms of money were agricultural commodities, such as grain or cattle. These goods were in high
        demand and traders knew that they would be able to use or trade these goods again in the future. Cocoa beans,
        cowrie shells, and agricultural tools have also served as early forms of money.

        As economies became more complex, money was standardized into currencies. This reduced transaction costs by
        making it easier to measure and compare value. Also, the representations of money became increasingly abstract,
        from precious metals and stamped coins to paper notes, and, in the modern era, electronic records.Money is any
        item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts,
        such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.[1][2][3] The primary functions which
        distinguish money are: medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of
        deferred payment.

        Money was historically an emergent market phenomenon that possessed intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all
        contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use value.[4] Its value is consequently
        derived by social convention, having been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender; that
        is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for "all debts, public and
        private", in the case of the United States dollar.

        The money supply of a country comprises all currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and,
        depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking
        accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, whose value exists on the books of
        financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used for cashless payment, forms by far the
        largest part of broad money in developed countries.</p>

    <p>In Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Stanley Jevons famously analyzed money in terms of four
        functions: a medium of exchange, a common measure of value (or unit of account), a standard of value (or
        standard of deferred payment), and a store of value. By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized
        in the couplet:

        Money's a matter of functions four,
        A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.[20]
        This couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks.[21] Most modern textbooks now list
        only three functions, that of medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, not considering a
        standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function, but rather subsuming it in the others.[4][22][23]

        There have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they
        need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all. One of these arguments is
        that the role of money as a medium of exchange conflicts with its role as a store of value: its role as a store
        of value requires holding it without spending, whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to
        circulate.[24] Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the
        fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term "financial
